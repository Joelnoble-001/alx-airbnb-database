# Complex SQL Joins
## 1. INNER JOIN
Retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings.

## 2. LEFT JOIN
Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.

## 3. FULL OUTER JOIN
Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.

# Subqueries Practice
## 1. Non-correlated Subquery
Find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0.

## 2. Correlated Subquery
Find all users who have made more than 3 bookings.

# Aggregations and Window Functions

## 2. Window Function
Rank properties based on the total number of bookings they have received using the `RANK()` window function.
